Epicentre's code repository for COVID-19 Country Situation Reports

## Package management

Package versions are stored in the `renv.lock` file, automatically created by the [`{renv}` package]().

After cloning this repository, you can build your isolated package library by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
renv::restore()
```

When a new package is required, after installation run `renv::snapshot()` to add the package to the lockfile that will be synced to bitbucket.


If you use Rstudio double-click on the file `episitrep_country_covid-19.Rproj` to start.

If you use `R` directly, make sure you launch `R` at the root folder of the project to allow `renv` to be activated properly.
