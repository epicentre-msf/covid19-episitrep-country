# COVID-19 Country EpiSitrep template

Epicentreâ€™s code repository for COVID-19 country-specific epidemiological situation reports.

## Package management

Package versions are stored in the `renv.lock` file, automatically created by the [`renv` package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

After cloning this repository, you can build your isolated package library by running:
```r
renv::restore()
```

When a new package is required, after installation run the command
```r 
renv::snapshot() 
```
to add the new package to the lockfile that will be synced to the Github repository.


After pulling from the Github repository, you may need to run the command
```r 
renv::status()
```
to check whether your packages are up to date. If not, follow instructions.



## From where to start

If you use Rstudio, double-click on the file `episitrep_country_covid-19.Rproj`.

If you use `R` directly, make sure you launch `R` at the root folder of the project to allow `renv` to be properly activated.
