title: "MSF country EpiSitrep on Covid-19 epidemic"
description: |
  This document presents tables, graphs and maps of the MSF Covid-19 linelists analyses for a single country (not much text). Most, but not all, of these analyses are presented and commented in the MSF Intersection Covid-19 EpiSitrep edited by Epicentre (for information on the EpiSitrep, please contact Anais.BROBAN@epicentre.msf.org).    
  
  The R scripts for both worldwide and MSF linelist analyses are provided on the following Github repository https://github.com/epicentre-msf/covid19-episitrep-country for epidemiologists in MSF to use (R skills required). The scripts will be updated from week to week as analysis progresses as requested.

# Data sources and definitions

This report uses the following data sources: 

  - [ECDC data](https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv) last updated `r format(max(dta_ecdc$date, na.rm = TRUE), "%d %b %Y")`.
  -	MSF linelists compiled by Epicentre
  -	MSF [GIS Unit](https://mapcentre.msf.org/) (baseline country maps)
  -	FIND [Diagnostics Resource Centre Unit](https://www.finddx.org/covid-19/) for data on Covid-19 tests

Definitions of increasing, declining and stable trends and the definition of doubling time, as well as detailed information on the analysis methods, can be found [here](https://msfintl-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/francesco_grandesso_epicentre_msf_org/EZqExKcP8axMj06voaLlveABpiicCfzkk5OWB-EaJvo9Fw?e=lwU1eM).

Additional graphics and tables are also available at the [Epicentre COVID-19 Epi Dashboard](https://reports.msf.net/public/covid19/).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Data and results presented here are possibly affected by bias related with factors such as the testing strategies used by each country and the performance of their surveillance systems. Results are to be interpreted in the light of this information.
